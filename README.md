#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
> Software engineering is the structured process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining software applications to ensure they meet users’ needs and operate efficiently. Software engineering provides the discipline and methodologies needed to create reliable, scalable, and secure software, fueling advancements in healthcare, finance, transportation, and beyond.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
> 1950s-1960s: The Birth of Programming Languages – Early languages like FORTRAN and COBOL set the foundation for more advanced software development by allowing developers to write higher-level code. 1970s: Structured Programming – This approach introduced systematic programming practices like modular code, which improved code readability, maintenance, and reusability. 2000s-Present: Agile and DevOps – Agile’s iterative, customer-focused approach and the later integration of DevOps practices accelerated delivery times and improved collaboration between development and operations teams, setting a new standard for modern software production.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
> Requirements and Specifications Gathering – Gathering and analyzing user needs to define the software’s objectives. 
> Design – Planning the architecture and structure of the software to meet requirements.
> Implementation – Writing the code based on the design specifications.
> Testing – Verifying that the software functions as expected and meets quality standards.
> Deployment – Releasing the software to end users. Maintenance – Providing ongoing support to address bugs, add features, and keep the software relevant.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
> Waterfall is a linear approach where each phase depends on the completion of the previous one. It’s well-suited for projects with clear, fixed requirements, such as large-scale systems in regulated industries like defense or healthcare while Agile is an iterative, flexible approach that allows for changes based on user feedback. It is ideal for projects requiring frequent updates or evolving requirements, like app development or web-based services.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
> Software Developer is responsible for writing, testing, and debugging code, as well as implementing features that meet project requirements while a Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer focuses on testing software to identify bugs, verify performance, and ensure quality standards are met and a project Manager oversees the project timeline, coordinates team efforts, manages risks, and communicates with stakeholders to keep the project on track.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
> IDEs are software development tools that have many development functionalities combined into a single application, examples are; Visual Studio Code, Intellij, Eclipse and then Version Control Systems are tracking and managing code changes over time and include git, subversion,mercurial.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
> It's very hard to kinda keep up with technology hence continuous learning and adapting to new tools is essential as well as attending different workshops to keep up-to-date.
> It's very hard to handle very complex codebases and using clear documentation would be a solution for such kind of applications
> It's very hard to meet deadlines as well as deliver high-quality software so it's advisable to prioritize high-risk codebases for testing and adopting agile processes

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
> Unit testing is testing for individual components ensuring each part works as intended, integration testing is testing that verifies different components work together correctly, system testing is testing for the entire software to make sure it meets the entire requirements, acceptance testing is testing that validates against user requirements, typically involving end users ensuring customer satisfaction.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
> Prompt engineering is the process of designing precise inputs or prompts to interact effectively with AI models and it’s essential because well-crafted prompts help AI generate accurate, useful responses, making it easier to get specific information or complete tasks efficiently.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
> Vague Prompt: “Tell me about the environment.” The Improved Prompt: “Summarize the current environmental challenges related to climate change, focusing on pollution, deforestation, and global warming.” - The improved prompt specifies the areas of pollution, deforestation, and global warming and adds context, allowing the AI to generate a more relevant and informative response.
